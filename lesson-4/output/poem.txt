Beyond the hills where shadows play, 
The morning sun begins its way, 
Through meadows green and skies of blue, 
Where dreams awaken, fresh and new. 
 
The whispers of the gentle breeze, 
Dance softly through the swaying trees, 
And in this moment, pure and bright, 
The world feels perfectly right.
